(BLEGH)

Hi, are you looking for the other side?
Feel like nothing ever seems quite right?
Are you circling the drainpipe, getting off on pain
like YOU'RE CORRUPTED?

I need to know where your loyalties lie.
Tell me, are you gonna bark or bite?
Do you really wanna twise the knife in the belly
OF THE MONSTER?

GET THE FUCK UP, WAKE THE FUCK UP, 
WIPE THE SYSTEM AND BACK THE FUCK UP!
YOU'RE A PUPPET WHEN THEY CUT YOUR STRINGS OFF!
DON'T COME CRAWLING BACK!

Kingslayer, destroying castles in the sky.
Kingslayer, forevermore the apple of my eye!
I'd sacrifice my life to find you, angel of the blade,
Kingslayer, come and collect us from the night!

暗い この見えない世界 [This dark, invisible world]
まだ消えない未来 [The future that won't disappear yet]
ただ手に入れたい [I just want to get to] another world.
SYSTEM FAILURE!
Life is encrypted, you're modified,
like a virus in a lullaby.
Artificial till the day you die, silly program,
YOU'RE CORRUPTED!

GET THE FUCK UP, WAKE THE FUCK UP, 
WIPE THE SYSTEM AND BACK THE FUCK UP!
YOU'RE A PUPPET WHEN THEY CUT YOUR STRINGS OFF!
DON'T COME CRAWLING BACK, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN!
さあ 時の
扉を開けて
行こうよ [Come on, let's open the door of time]!

Kingslayer, destroying castles in the sky.
Kingslayer, I'll fight for you until I die!

Kingslayer, destroying castles in the sky.
Kingslayer, forevermore the apple of my eye!
I'd sacrifice it all to guide you,
never have to battle alone!
Kingslayer, come and collect us from the night!

This is your wake-up call.
We're going down the rabbit hole.
Are you ready?
I CAN'T FEEL YOU!

IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT?
THIS IS WHAT YOU'LL FUCKING GET,
YOU MOTHERFUCKING SHIT!
