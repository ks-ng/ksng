# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest version will be supported for security fixes; all patches will be given to the latest update.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If a vulnerability is found, report it to the Issues page and indicate that there is a security flaw. ASAP, a fix will be posted; as soon as it is, get updates from the repo to patch the system.
For all intents and purposes, there are two types of security issues:
 1. **Minor issues** that might make certain tools less useful or less secure under certain circumstances
 2. **Major issues** that make KSNG insecure to use due to an exploit
Both types should be reported as soon as possible so that they can be fixed.
